RKE version: v0.3.2 

These are the steps to restore from a backup snapshot using RKE. Earlier versions of RKE stored a file called pki.bundle.tar.gz, this version does not and instead uses the cluster.rkestate file. 

I currently have my cluster.yaml
file to send my backups to S3. I then take my cluster.rkestate file
and move it to another directory to save it (a better option would be to save to S3) or it will get deleted when running the remove command below. Then I run snapshot-save:
 
rke etcd snapshot-save --name mysnapshot.db --config cluster.yaml
  # this saves a snapshot in my bucket as mysnapshot.db using the original cluster.yaml

I then move the cluster.rkestate file to another directory to keep from
being deleted and run rke remove (file is needed to restore back up or you will have cert problem).

rke remove --force --config cluster.yaml
  # this is to similate a failure of your cluster

I know want to restore and use the same cluster.yaml by moving back my cluster.rkestate file
in the same directory as my cluster.yaml as well as downloading my previously saved 
snapshot-rancher.db.zip from S3, this file is also in the same directory as my cluster.yaml.
I also make a change in nodes in my cluster.yaml. I remove the etcd and control plane and replace it with another node address and assign the etcd and control plane role. Then I run these commands:

Note: it is necessary to have all files in the same directory, these include your cluster.yaml, cluster.rkestate and mysnapshot.db files

unzip snapshot-rancher.db.zip
rke etcd snapshot-restore --name mysnapshot.db --config cluster.yaml
  #--name is the name of the backup file

done
